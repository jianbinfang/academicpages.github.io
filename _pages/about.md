Jianbin Fang is a computer research scientist within the Institute for Computer Systems at National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). 
He has received a BSc degree in Computer Science from Central South University (CSU), China in 2007, 
and a MSc degree in Computer Science from NUDT in 2009. 
In October 2014, he earned his PhD degree in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), the Netherlands, 
under the supervision of Prof. Henk Sips and Dr. Ana Lucia Varbanescu. 

Jianbin's general research area is High-performance Computing and System Software.
And he is particularly interested in parallel programming for (heterogeneous) many-core architectures, parallel compilers and run-time systems, performance modeling, and scalable algorithms.

His PhD thesis is on "Towards a Systematic Exploration of the Optimization Space for Many-Core Processors" ([see here](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:0b5408a7-933c-4369-8d48-1db5d3269d72)), where he has investigated the enabling/disabling techniques for platform-specific optimizations with a unified programming model.
