collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-07-16-pact
excerpt: 'This paper presents POEM, a novel framework that automatically learns useful code representations from graph-based program structures. At the core of P OEM is a new graph neural network (GNN), which is specially designed for capturing the syntax and semantic information from the program abstract syntax tree and the control and data flow graph.'
