This article develops a novel resource allocation scheme for memory-bound applications
running on High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, aiming to improve application performance without
breaching peak power constraints and total energy consumption. 
Our scheme estimates how the number of processor cores and CPU frequency setting affects the application performance. It then uses the estimate to
provide additional compute nodes to memory-bound applications if it is profitable to do so. We implement and apply
our algorithm to 12 representative benchmarks from the NAS parallel benchmark and HPC Challenge (HPCC)
benchmark suites and evaluate it on a representative HPC cluster.
