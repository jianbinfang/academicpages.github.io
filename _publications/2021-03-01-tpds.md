title: 'BALS: Blocked Alternating Least Squares for Parallel Sparse Matrix Factorization on GPUs'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-03-01-tpds
excerpt: 'This article presents an efficient implementation of the alternative least squares (ALS) algorithm called BALS built on top of
a new sparse matrix format for parallel matrix factorization. <span style="color:red">Note that the reviewing process spans from April 2, 2018 to March 1, 2021, which is the most time-consuming one I have ever seen. </span>.'
