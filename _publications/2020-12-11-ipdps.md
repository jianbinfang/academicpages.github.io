title: 'Characterizing Small-Scale Matrix Multiplications on ARMv8-based Many-Core Architectures'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-12-11-ipdps
excerpt: 'General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a key
subroutine in high-performance computing. There is a large
body of work on evaluating and optimizing large-scale matrix
multiplication, but how well the small-scale matrix multiplication (SMM) performs is largely unknown, especially for the
ARMv8-based many-core architectures. In this work, we evaluate and characterize the performance of SMM subroutines
on Phytium 2000+, an ARMv8-based 64-core architecture. The evaluation work is extensively performed with the mainstream
open-source libraries including OpenBLAS, BLIS, BALSFEO, and Eigen. Given various experimental settings, we observe how
well the small-scale GEMM routines perform on Phytium 2000+, and then discuss the impacting factors behind the performance
behaviours of SMM.'
